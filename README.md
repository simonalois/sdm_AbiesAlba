Description of prediciton task
The tree species silver fir is a natural component of mountain forest in the federal state of Tyrol and in most parts of the European Alps and elsewhere. Due to intensive historical use of the forest with clear cuts and high stocks of ungulate game in recent decades, this tree species became vary rare. Nevertheless, silver fir provides important ecosystem services as soil stabilisation and turned out to be resilient to climate change. Moreover, in terms of biodiversity and habitat provision it is an important part of mountain forest ecosystems. 
Due to the currently reduced occurrence of the tree species not all adequate sites are known. Therefore, the prediction of silver fir occurrence in Tyrol is necessary.
The classification algorithm could be used to decide if a specific forest site is appropriate for the growth of silver fir.
